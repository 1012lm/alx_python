# Geometry Classes Project

This project consists of two classes, `Rectangle` and `Square`, that represent geometric shapes.

### Usage

                    ### Rectangle 
To create a `Rectangle` object, initialize it with the `width` and `height` parameters:

rectangle = Rectangle(width, height)
The width and height parameters must be positive integers. Otherwise, a ValueError will be raised.

The Rectangle class provides the following methods:

area(): Calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
__str__(): Returns a string representation of the rectangle in the format "[Rectangle] width/height".

                    ## Square Class
The Square class is defined in the file square.py. It inherits from the Rectangle class and represents a special case of a rectangle where all sides are of equal length.

Usage
To create a Square object, initialize it with the size parameter:

square = Square(size)
The size parameter must be a positive integer. Otherwise, a ValueError will be raised.

The Square class provides the following methods:

area(): Calculates and returns the area of the square.
__str__(): Returns a string representation of the square in the format "[Square] size/size".
